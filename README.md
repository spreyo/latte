# latte
Latte is a simple ping / latency measuring tool. It was originally written in python as just a command line app, but since  python apps are hard to distribute and I love designing GUIs, I remade it using the ElectronJS framework and React. It runs the python script as a side process in the background and creates an interface for it.
# Installation

*Latte is currently only available for Windows, but there will be support for other platforms soon.*

## Windows
